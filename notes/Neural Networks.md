##Todays Task: Create a rudimentary neural network

##10^24 Neurons in the human brain

###AI's are built to mimic the neural structure of the human brain.

###Inputs->Outputs based on weights. As the model learns it will adjust the weights. Additional layers allow more complexity in decision making

###sigmoid function maps any input to an output inbetween 0 and 1
